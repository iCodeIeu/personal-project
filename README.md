# Project Overview

This project implements a robust and efficient test automation framework, incorporating the following key features and improvements:

## Page Object Model (POM)

Organized Locators: Centralized page locators for a single source of truth.
Improved Readability: Enhanced code readability and maintainability.

## Component Model

Reusable Components: Isolated shared component locators for efficient reuse.
Consistent Updates: Ensured consistent updates across multiple page objects.

## Version Control Best Practices

.gitignore: Prevents accidental commits of sensitive configuration files.
.prettierrc.json: Maintains consistent code formatting for better readability.

## Test Execution Optimization

Parallel Execution: Reduced test suite execution time for faster feedback loops.
Granular Debugging: Facilitated more precise debugging of individual test cases.

## Helper Functions

Reusability: Centralized common API and UI helper methods for efficient code reuse.
Reduced Clutter: Improved test file organization and reduced redundancy.
